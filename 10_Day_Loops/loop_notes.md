## Loops in Python

# While Loop syntax

while condition:
code goes here

# Keywords

- Break: we use break when we like to get out of or stop the loop. before its completed. Nothing gets executed after this
  - Example: we loop through a range of 5 and want to stop the loop when it reaches 3
- Continue: we can skip the current iteration, and continue with the next:

# For Loop

- Where it's used: iterate over a sequence
  - list
  - tuple
  - dictionary (gives the key only or both keys and values)
  - set
  - string

# Range Function

- Range(start, end, step)

# For Else

- Usage: execute a message when the loop ends

# Pass

- Usage: if we don't want to execute a code, to avoid errors

# NEED Research!!!!!!

- Explain how nested loops work
- Explain the break and continue statement in loop
- Pass statement
