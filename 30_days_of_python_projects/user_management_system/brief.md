## Project 3: User Management System (CLI-Based)

### Project Description

Develop a command-line user management system that simulates how backend systems manage users. This project mirrors real-world API and database-style logic using in-memory data structures.

### Core Objectives

- Manage users using structured data
- Perform CRUD-style operations
- Validate and process user input

### Key Features

- Create users with unique IDs
- Store user profiles (name, age, skills, status)
- Validate age and unique emails/usernames
- Search users by name or skill
- Update and delete user records
- Display formatted user profiles

### Example Data Structure

```python
{
  "id": "X7kP9A",
  "name": "User Name",
  "age": 25,
  "skills": ["Python", "SQL"],
  "active": True
}
```
