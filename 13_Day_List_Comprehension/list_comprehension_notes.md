# 📝 List Comprehension in Python

List comprehensions provide a **short, readable way** to create lists from iterables (strings, ranges, other lists, etc.).

---

## 🔹 Basic Syntax

```python
[expression for item in iterable if condition]

    - expression → what you want to store in the list
    - for item in iterable → loop through each element
    - if condition (optional) → filter items

## 📌 Key Use Cases
    1. Converting Iterables
    2. Generating Numbers
    3. Conditional Filtering
    4. Flattening Nested Lists

## 👉 Quick Tips

    - Read left to right: expression → loop → condition.
    - Cleaner & faster than a for loop when building new lists.
    - Use conditions (if) to filter items.
    - You can nest loops for flattening or generating combinations.


## ✅ Rule of Thumb:

    - Use list comprehensions for simple, readable transformations.
    - Use regular loops if the logic is too complex (to keep readability).
